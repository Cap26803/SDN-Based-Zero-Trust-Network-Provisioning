# Literature Survey - SDN-Based Zero Trust Network

This section contains a structured overview of academic and industrial research works that shaped the foundation of our project on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) integrated with Zero Trust Network (ZTN) security principles.

---

## Purpose

The literature survey provides:
- A background on the evolution of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA).
- Insights into SDN integration with modern cybersecurity frameworks.
- Comparative evaluation of the most relevant approaches from the academic world.

## Relevance to Our Project

The selected literature offers a deep insight into:
- The necessity of Zero Trust in modern networks.
- How SDN complements ZTN in terms of flexibility and real-time control.
- Real-world implementation strategies for scalable and secure academic networks.

These papers helped us:
- Validate our problem statement.
- Adopt proven Zero Trust mechanisms.
- Structure our testing, threat detection, and policy enforcement techniques.
