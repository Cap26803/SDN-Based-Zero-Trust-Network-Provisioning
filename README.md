# SDN-Based Zero Trust Network Provisioning

A Capstone Project implementing a Zero Trust Network (ZTN) security model using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to enhance network security through access control and monitoring.

---

## üîê What is Zero Trust Network (ZTN)?

**Zero Trust Network (ZTN)** is a security architecture that follows the principle of ‚Äúnever trust, always verify.‚Äù It eliminates implicit trust by continuously validating users, devices, and services before granting access to network resources‚Äîregardless of whether the connection originates internally or externally.

### üè´ ZTN in a University Scenario

In this project, ZTN is implemented in an academic setting as follows:

- **Role-Based Dashboards** ensure students, faculty, and admin users can access only authorized data and services.
- **Authentication & IP Validation** mechanisms enforce strict verification before granting access.
- **SDN Controller** monitors network traffic and dynamically blocks attackers based on their behavior.
- **Password Reset Alerts** notify users of suspicious activity, such as repeated failed logins.

This aligns with real-world university networks where internal and external threats must be contained, and access should be minimal and role-specific.

### üåê Applicability to Other Scenarios

The ZTN model used here is modular and adaptable. It can be extended to:

- **Corporate Networks** for employee access control
- **Healthcare Systems** to protect patient data
- **IoT Environments** for device validation
- **Government or Military** setups for sensitive operations

By modifying the user roles, network topology, and access policies, this architecture can be deployed in virtually any scenario demanding strong security and trust management.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of Zero Trust principles with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to create a secure and scalable network environment. The system ensures that no device or user is trusted by default, verifying every network interaction based on identity.

Using **Mininet** for network simulation and **Open vSwitch (OVS)** for traffic control, the system automatically detects unknown devices, blocks their communication using OpenFlow rules, and logs the events in both a **MySQL database** and **JSON files**. A role-based dashboard provides **Admin**, **Faculty**, and **Students** with controlled access and network visibility.

---

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Separate dashboards for Admin, Faculty, and Students with role-specific functionalities.
- **Real-Time Attack Detection**: Automatic blocking of unknown or unauthorized IP addresses using SDN flow rules.
- **Centralized Logging**: User activities and attacker attempts are logged in a MySQL database and JSON files.
- **Network Visualization**: Real-time network topology visualization using **Vis.js**.
- **Password Reset Alerts**: Alerts are triggered after suspicious login patterns.
- **Multi-Role Dashboard**: Interactive dashboards with login analytics, marks management, and threat alerts.
